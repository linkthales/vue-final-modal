# Showing / Hiding Modals

There are three ways you can control a modal:

1. Toggle the `v-model` to true/false
2. Use the `$vfm` API
3. Use dynamic modals

## 1. Toggle the `v-model` to true/false

// TODO

## 2. Use the `$vfm` API

You can use the `$vfm` API to control modals with functions like `$vfm.show(modalName)` and `$vfm.hide(modalName)`. This is handy to control modals you included in one Vue file but want to show/hide from another.

For more details see the section on [$vfm API](/controlling-modals/vfm-api.html).

## 3. Use dynamic modals

// TODO
